# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction

A machine learning project to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on diagnostic health measurements.

## 📊 Overview

This project leverages machine learning techniques to build a predictive model for diabetes diagnosis using patient health data. It aims to assist healthcare professionals and researchers in early detection of diabetes risks.


## 📚 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) from Kaggle, containing several medical predictor variables and one target variable indicating diabetes presence.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook
